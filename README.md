3devoUpdate
===========
This tool is a simple GUI wrapper around avrdude and dfu-util, and is 
intended to simplify the uploading of new firmware files to the 3devo
products with USB cable connectivity.

This tool is essentially a stripped down version of the
[avrdudess](https://github.com/zkemble/AVRDUDESS/) program with
additional support for [dfu-util](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-util/files/).

See src/3devoUpdate/README-binary.md for information on the license of this
and included software.
