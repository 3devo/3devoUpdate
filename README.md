3devoUpdate
===========
This tool is a simple GUI wrapper around avrdude, and is intended to
simplify the uploading of new firmware files to the 3devo Next 1.0
Filament Extruder.

This tool is essentially a stripped down version of the
[avrdudess](https://github.com/zkemble/AVRDUDESS/) program.

See src/avrdudess/README-binary.md for information on the license of this
and included software.
