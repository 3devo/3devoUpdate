Changes since version 1.3

  type allows the 3devoUpdate tool to check if firmware matches the selected
  device, to prevent uploading firmware to the wrong device.
- Reword some texts and improve the layout a bit.
- Improve the handling of a lot of errors in cases where problems occur during
  usage.
- Selecting a device for a firmware upload should work better now. With
  3devoUpdate V1.3 it could happen that, after a device selection, it would
  not allow users to upload firmware (it kept the upload button disabled).
- Various internal improvements.
